# Medical Provider Fraud Detection
Data Originate from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohitrox/medical-provider-fraud-detection)
# Summary
The data consists of three files: Inpatient, Outpatients, and Beneficiary. All of them have numerical and categorical features. The features relate to financial insurance, health conditions, and social background. The data is imbalanced, so we must create and standardize new features. Some null values can be filled or dropped. The result is logistic classification showed the highest accuracy and F1 Score, mainly with features that aggregate financial and provider. The provider may be the perpetrator of the fraud, which is why certain physicians and diseases have a high frequency of fraud.   

# Objective
To explain technical methods from end to end. Furthermore, We need to determine a suitable model for classification regression. Lastly, We must choose the correct assessment matrix for the model performance.

# Problem Definition
The data is split into three files: Inpatient, Outpatient, and Beneficiary. Furthermore, the data shows which cases are fraud, which is helpful to determine potential fraud. With classification regression, we can create a classification model. Performance can be improved by new feature creation and model selection. 

# Steps
1. Data Preparation, Cleansing, and Engineering
2. EDA
3. Regression Model 
4. Model Assessments
